# Differential-equations
This repository includes several personal projects and scripts for the numerical solution of ODEs and PDEs. Everything is written in Julia, packages in use are, for example, DifferentialEquations.jl, CUDA.jl and Makie.jl.
For some equations, there is only one script, in case of more complex projects such as the incompressible Navier-Stokes solver, the main.jl is the script to be run.
