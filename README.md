# Differential-equations
This repository includes several personal projects and scripts for the numerical solution of ODEs and PDEs. Everything is written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/), packages in use are, for example, [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl), [CUDA.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl) and [Makie.jl](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl).
For some equations, there is only one script, in case of more complex projects such as the incompressible Navier-Stokes solver, the main.jl is the script to be run.
